What happends when using the tracert command?

-Tracert command utilizes ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol)
-Targets the host using TTL by setting a value in the packets.
-TTL is set to 1 for the first packet and increased by 1 for subsequent packets.
-TTL determines maximum number of hops where the packets goes through before it being discarded.
-By increasing the TTL for each subsequent packet, tracert can determine number of switches or routers.
-When a packets navigates through a router the TTL value is decreased by 1. When it reaches 0 the router will discard the packet and send it back to ICMP Time Exceeded message to the sender
-When a router decreases the TTL to 0 and discards the packet and responds back with a Time Exceeded message.
-When TTL gets increased and traceroute finds each step of the path to the destination until the host is reached.
-Respons with Echo to end =>Sends a ICMP Echo Request packets and the destination responds with ICMP
